# Kruskal's Algorithm

## Description
This repository contains an implementation of **Kruskal's Algorithm** in **C**. Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the **minimum spanning tree (MST)** of a connected, weighted graph by selecting edges in order of increasing weight and using a **Union-Find** structure to avoid cycles.

### Key Features:
- Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph
- Uses Union-Find operations for cycle detection
- Efficiently handles large graphs with multiple edges

For detailed information about the algorithm, refer to the Kruskal's Algorithm pseudocode in the documentation.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C program.
3. Run the executable, providing the input file containing the graph's edge list and vertices.
